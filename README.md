# Landing Page
The first website/landing page called Foster Fitness created using HTML with CSS. This idea was inspired by my passion for coding and spreading the good health benefits of exercise which can improve the lives of everyone! For now, just the landing page will be available but I will add other links, animations, and features in the future.

Let me know your feedback about the design of the page or any improvements you can suggest :).
